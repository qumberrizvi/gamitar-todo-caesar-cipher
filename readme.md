## Frontend Libraries and Frameworks

If I were to use frontend libraries or frameworks instead of plain JavaScript, the following could have been used:

- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface with reusable components.
- **Vue.js**: For an easy-to-integrate and reactive UI.
- **Angular**: For a full-fledged framework providing a complete solution including state management and form handling.

These frameworks would have helped by providing built-in solutions for state management, component lifecycle, and more
robust form handling, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage.
